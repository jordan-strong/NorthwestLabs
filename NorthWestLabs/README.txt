\
developed by Alex Pericle, Jordan Strong, Tyler Mabey and Laura Branham\

\
This project contains the prototype website for the new Northwest Labs system. The website has limited functionality as the purpose of this prototype is mainly to provide the basic look and feel of the new design. Models, views, and controllers have been fully developed for five use cases.\
\
The five use cases that can be demonstrated in extra detail are:\
-Accounting > Create Invoice\
